# What is a CSP ("Constraint Satisfaction Problem")?

It is a type of problem which can be modeled using
1. A set of variables V = {v_1, ..., v_n}, n >= 1
2. A set of variables domain D = {D_1, ..., D_n}, such that v_i is in D_i
3. A set of constraints C = {c_1, ..., c_m}, m >= 1

A state is an attribution of a value in of D_j to v_j, 
where j in J and J is a subset {1, ..., n}.

Every value of v_i must respect all constraints c_1, ..., c_m to
be said CONSISTENT. In systhesis, we want to find a solution to
the problem always mantaining all variables with consistent values.

A attribution is said to be COMPLETE when all variables v_1, ..., v_n
has a value. Note that this has nothing to do with CONSISTENCY, becau-
se a COMPLETE attribution does not require all of these values to be
CONSISTENT.

A SOLUTION is a COMPLETE and CONSISTENT attribution.
